# 2026 Revamp

Inspired by the ["WEIRD Audits?" paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3715275.3732026), this is an attempt to organize audit work that's been published since the 2021 review.

The main goals are: 
(1) Collect and label algorithm audit studies
    (a) Directly from results shared in the WEIRD Audits publish
    (b) Any additional audits found through screening
(2) Create a web interface for viewing/exploring the audits
